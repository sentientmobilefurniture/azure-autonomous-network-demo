Title: Fibre splice degradation LINK-SYD-ADL-FIBRE-01 — corrosion
Severity: P3
Root Cause: LINK-SYD-ADL-FIBRE-01
Root Cause Type: HARDWARE_DEGRADATION
Created: 2026-02-05T10:00:00Z
Resolved: 2026-02-06T10:00:00Z
SLA Breached: No

Description:
Gradual optical power degradation on the inland SYD-ADL fibre due to splice corrosion at Broken Hill junction point. Optical power dropped from -3dBm to -18dBm over 3 weeks.

Detection Method:
Trend analysis on OpticalPowerDbm time-series

Resolution:
Field team dispatched to Broken Hill junction. Corroded splice replaced. Optical power restored to normal.

Customer Impact:
(None)

Time to Detect: 86400 seconds
Time to Reroute: 0 seconds
Time to Resolve: 1440 minutes

Lessons Learned:
SYD-ADL inland fibre is the last-resort alternate path for Perth-bound traffic. Its degradation wasn't detected for 3 weeks because it's a low-utilisation standby link. Must add proactive optical power monitoring on ALL links, not just high-utilisation ones.
