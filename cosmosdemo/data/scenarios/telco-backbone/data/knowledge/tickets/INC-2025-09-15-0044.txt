Title: Microwave link degradation ADL-PER — atmospheric ducting
Severity: P3
Root Cause: LINK-ADL-PER-MICROWAVE-01
Root Cause Type: ATMOSPHERIC_INTERFERENCE
Created: 2025-09-15T08:00:00Z
Resolved: 2025-09-15T14:00:00Z
SLA Breached: No

Description:
Temperature inversion caused atmospheric ducting on the ADL-PER microwave link. Signal-to-noise ratio dropped, causing intermittent packet loss of 3-8% over 6 hours. Subsided naturally as weather changed.

Detection Method:
Threshold-based alerting on PacketLossPct

Resolution:
No action required — atmospheric ducting resolved naturally. Adaptive modulation on microwave reduced throughput to 6G during event.

Customer Impact:
(None)

Services Affected: 0
Alerts Generated: 34
Alerts Suppressed: 0
Time to Detect: 600 seconds
Time to Reroute: 0 seconds
Time to Resolve: 360 minutes

Lessons Learned:
Microwave link capacity drops significantly during atmospheric events. Current 10G rated capacity may reduce to 6G or lower. Factor this into capacity planning for submarine cable failure scenarios.
