1. Add follow up actions
2. Add real alerting infrastructure with alert generators
3. For telco-backbone, need prompts + alerting that allows us to show the full suite of multiagent execution - Maybe change the validator
4. Resource visualizer kind of sucks - It's not showing relationships between tools and their datasources and then the data and the underlying infrastructure etc... The nodes are there but the relationships are now. 
5. No custom scenario naming allowed anymore. Only names specified in scenario.yamls are allowed. Some UI changes are needed 
6. move tarballs into the folders they belong to - need to change tarball generation script. 
7. Scenario dropdown needs to be wider 
8. Example questions should not just be in scenario info. Should also be in a dropdown menu next to the 'submit alert' chatbox.
