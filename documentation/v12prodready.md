1. Add follow up actions
2. Add real alerting infrastructure with alert generators
3. For telco-backbone, need prompts + alerting that allows us to show the full suite of multiagent execution - Maybe change the validator
4. Remove that "validating thing". Have there be a button to explicitly retriev available scenarios
