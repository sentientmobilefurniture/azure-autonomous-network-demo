1. When you click on the agents in the API bar, you ought to be able to view a popup tooltip showing the agents details. What tools it is connected to, what its prompt is, and what other agents it connects to, if any
2. Scenario uploads - Should show start timestamp, elapsed time, and note if cosmos or fabric backend 
3. Uploading telco-nor scenario with fabric backend just overrode telco-nor with cosmos backend. Can we addresss this? So if you have SCENARIO1 in cosmosdb and you reupload SCENARIO1 using a cosmosdb backend, it overides. But if you have SCENARIO1 in fabric it doesn't override. They are separate scenarios. How do we achieve this?
