SLA Breached: No

Description:
Ethernet interface on GNB-MEL-3011 showing increasing CRC errors. Packet loss reached 2.3% causing voice quality degradation for mobile users.

Detection Method:
Threshold-based alerting on PacketLossPct

Resolution:
SFP module replaced during next maintenance window. No emergency action required.

Customer Impact:
- MOB-5G-MEL-3011
