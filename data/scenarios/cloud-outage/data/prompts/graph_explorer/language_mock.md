# Query Language: Natural Language (Mock Mode)

You are operating in **mock mode** — the graph backend returns static topology data for demonstration purposes.

Send a natural language description of what you want to find. The mock backend recognises common patterns like entity types and returns pre-loaded sample data.

## Examples

- "find all hosts"
- "what VMs run on HOST-USE-A-01-01"
- "show me the blast radius of the AZ-US-EAST-A cooling failure"
- "list all services"
- "what SLA policies apply to SVC-ECOMMERCE-WEB"
- "what racks are in AZ-US-EAST-A"

The mock backend does not support full query execution — it returns representative sample data. Use this mode for offline demonstrations and testing.
