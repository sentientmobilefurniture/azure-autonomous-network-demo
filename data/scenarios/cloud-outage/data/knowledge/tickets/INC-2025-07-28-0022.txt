Title: OOM kill cascade on cache nodes — Redis cluster partition
Severity: P1
Root Cause: VM-USE-A-0202-01
Root Cause Type: OOM_KILL
Created: 2025-07-28T09:05:15Z
Resolved: 2025-07-28T10:30:15Z
SLA Breached: No

Description:
Memory leak in Redis 7.2.1 caused OOM kills on cache-node-1 and cache-node-2. Without cache, database query volume spiked 12x, degrading all API responses.

Detection Method:
Automated OOM alert from kernel

Resolution:
Restarted Redis processes with memory limit enforcement. Upgraded to Redis 7.2.3 (memory leak fix) during next maintenance window.

Customer Impact:
- SVC-CACHE-CLUSTER
- SVC-ECOMMERCE-API
- SVC-ECOMMERCE-WEB

Services Affected: 3
Alerts Generated: 1523
Alerts Suppressed: 1500
Time to Detect: 5 seconds
Time to Resolve: 85 minutes

Lessons Learned:
Add memory utilization trend monitoring with 24h projection. Implement circuit breaker pattern between API and cache to gracefully degrade without cascading to DB.
