Incident: INC-2026-01-18-0007
Title: Rolling update gone wrong — API gateway version mismatch
Severity: P2
Root Cause: SVC-ECOMMERCE-API
Root Cause Type: ROLLING_UPDATE_FAILURE
Created: 2026-01-18T15:30:00Z
Resolved: 2026-01-18T16:45:00Z
SLA Breached: No

Description:
Rolling update deployed API v3.2.0 alongside v3.1.8 instances. Breaking schema change in v3.2.0 caused 50% of requests to fail depending on which instance handled them.

Detection Method:
Automated error rate spike alert

Resolution:
Rolled back to v3.1.8. Implemented blue-green deployment for breaking changes.

Customer Impact:
- SVC-ECOMMERCE-API
- SVC-ECOMMERCE-WEB
- SVC-PAYMENT

Services Affected: 3
Alerts Generated: 543
Alerts Suppressed: 500
Time to Detect: 20 seconds
Time to Resolve: 75 minutes

Lessons Learned:
Enforce semantic versioning — major version bumps require blue-green deployment. Add API schema compatibility checks to CI pipeline.
