Description:
Severe thunderstorm caused tree fall on aerial fibre section near Goulburn. Both FIBRE-01 and FIBRE-02 impacted (same conduit route). No alternate direct path available.

Automated alert storm detection

Resolution:
Emergency traffic rerouted via SYD-BNE-MEL indirect path (higher latency). Physical repair took 18 hours due to access issues.
