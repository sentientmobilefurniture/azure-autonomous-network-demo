Incident: INC-2025-11-14-0008
Title: OSPF flap storm CORE-ADL-01 — interface CRC errors
Severity: P2
Root Cause: CORE-ADL-01
Root Cause Type: HARDWARE_DEGRADATION
Created: 2025-11-14T03:15:00Z
Resolved: 2025-11-14T04:00:00Z
SLA Breached: No

Description:
Degrading SFP on CORE-ADL-01 Gi0/0/0/2 interface caused intermittent CRC errors, triggering OSPF adjacency flaps every 90 seconds. Generated 800+ alerts per hour.

Detection Method:
Alert rate anomaly — periodic pattern detected

Resolution:
SFP module replaced during emergency maintenance window. OSPF stabilised immediately.

Customer Impact:
(None)

Services Affected: 0
Alerts Generated: 2400
Alerts Suppressed: 2399
Time to Detect: 120 seconds
Time to Reroute: 0 seconds
Time to Resolve: 45 minutes

Lessons Learned:
CORE-ADL-01 is a critical convergence point for both east coast and Perth traffic. Hardware degradation at this node has outsized impact. Implement proactive SFP monitoring with optical power trend analysis.
