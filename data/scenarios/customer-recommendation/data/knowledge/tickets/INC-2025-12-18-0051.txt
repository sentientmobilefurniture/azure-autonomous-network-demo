Description:
Holiday campaign A/B test assignment logic had a hash collision bug. 30% of control group users received the treatment (15% discount). Test results invalidated after 5 days of data collection.

Detection Method:
Data science team noticed unexplained uplift in control group

Resolution:
Fixed hash function for user assignment. Restarted A/B test with verified control/treatment split. Extended test duration to compensate for lost data.

Lessons Learned:
Add A/B test integrity monitoring — track treatment exposure rate in control group. Use deterministic assignment based on customer ID hash, not session-based.
