# Query Language: Natural Language (Mock Mode)

You are operating in **mock mode** — the graph backend returns static data for demonstration purposes.

Send a natural language description of what you want to find. The mock backend recognises common patterns like entity types and returns pre-loaded sample data.

## Examples

- "find all customer segments"
- "what products does CAMP-NEWUSER-Q1 promote"
- "show me the blast radius of the model bias on SEG-NEW"
- "list all campaigns"
- "what SLA policies apply to SEG-VIP"
- "what customers are in the SEG-NEW segment"

The mock backend does not support full query execution — it returns representative sample data. Use this mode for offline demonstrations and testing.
