Severity: P2
Root Cause: FW-PER-01
Root Cause Type: SOFTWARE_BUG
Created: 2025-10-03T11:20:00Z
Resolved: 2025-10-03T12:50:00Z
SLA Breached: No

Description:
Known Fortinet firmware bug caused FW-PER-01 active node to crash during deep packet inspection of encrypted traffic. Passive node took over but with 45-second gap in stateful inspection.

Detection Method:
Firewall health monitoring — heartbeat timeout

Resolution:
Emergency firmware patch applied (hotfix from vendor). Active/passive roles rebalanced.

Customer Impact:
- VPN-IRONORE-CORP
- VPN-WESTGAS-CORP

Services Affected: 2
Alerts Generated: 156
Alerts Suppressed: 155
Time to Detect: 10 seconds
Time to Reroute: 45 seconds
Time to Resolve: 90 minutes

Lessons Learned:
Perth firewall is a single cluster — no geographic redundancy. Consider deploying secondary inspection path via Adelaide firewall for critical mining and energy VPN traffic.
