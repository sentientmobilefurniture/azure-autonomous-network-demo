SLA Breached: Yes

Description:
Fishing trawler anchor drag on the Great Australian Bight submarine cable caused partial fibre strand damage. Signal degradation over 2 hours before automatic failover to microwave backup.

Detection Method:
Anomaly detection on optical power time-series — gradual decay pattern

Resolution:
Traffic rerouted to LINK-ADL-PER-MICROWAVE-01 (10G backup). Cable repair vessel dispatched — full repair in 14 days.

Time to Resolve: 20160 minutes

Lessons Learned:
Microwave backup (10G) insufficient for full submarine cable load (40G). Perth services were degraded for 14 days during cable repair. Need to establish emergency satellite backhaul or negotiate lit fibre from alternate carrier.
