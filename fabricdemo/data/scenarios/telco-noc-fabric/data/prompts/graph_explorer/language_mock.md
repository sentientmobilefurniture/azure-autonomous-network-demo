# Query Language: Natural Language (Mock Mode)

You are operating in **mock mode** — the graph backend returns static topology data for demonstration purposes.

Send a natural language description of what you want to find. The mock backend recognises common patterns like entity types and returns pre-loaded sample data.

## Examples

- "find all core routers"
- "what services depend on LINK-SYD-MEL-FIBRE-01"
- "show me the blast radius of the SYD-MEL fibre cut"
- "list all MPLS paths"
- "what SLA policies apply to VPN-ACME-CORP"

The mock backend does not support full query execution — it returns representative sample data. Use this mode for offline demonstrations and testing.
