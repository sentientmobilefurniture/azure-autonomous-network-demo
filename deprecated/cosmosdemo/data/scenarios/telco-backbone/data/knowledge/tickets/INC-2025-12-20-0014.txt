Incident: INC-2025-12-20-0014
Title: Defence VPN latency breach — SYD-CBR path congestion
Severity: P1
Root Cause: LINK-SYD-CBR-FIBRE-01
Root Cause Type: CAPACITY_CONGESTION
Created: 2025-12-20T16:45:00Z
Resolved: 2025-12-20T17:07:00Z
SLA Breached: Yes

Description:
Holiday traffic surge combined with Defence data transfer saturated LINK-SYD-CBR-FIBRE-01. VPN-GOVDEFENCE latency exceeded PLATINUM SLA threshold (10ms) for 22 minutes.

Detection Method:
Real-time SLA monitoring — latency threshold breach

Resolution:
Traffic engineering prioritized Defence traffic via QoS reclassification. Capacity upgrade planned for Q1 2026.

Customer Impact:

Alerts Suppressed: 66
Time to Detect: 15 seconds
Time to Reroute: 0 seconds
Time to Resolve: 22 minutes

Lessons Learned:
PLATINUM SLA (99.999%, 10ms) requires dedicated bandwidth reservation, not just QoS priority. The SYD-CBR corridor needs a dedicated wavelength for government traffic.
